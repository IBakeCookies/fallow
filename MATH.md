# Zenith — Mathematical Model, Derivations, and Change Log

This document is the authoritative record of the math implemented in
`src/lib/business/model/zenith.ts`: what the model is, how every formula is
derived, and — most importantly — **what we changed relative to the source
article and why**, so future readers don't have to reverse-engineer the
reasoning from code.

- Source article: [The Zenith Gradient Algorithm](https://thequantasticjournal.com/how-to-over-engineer-a-todo-app-the-zenith-gradient-algorithm-67712737135e)
  (copy in `/zenith.md`)
- Model **v1** = the article's math plus our earlier robustness fixes
  (ridge-regularized constants fit, ϕ floor, per-task optimum caps,
  switch-cost drop search).
- Model **v2** = the 2026-07 revision documented here: new productivity curve,
  per-task optimal stopping, discrete exact allocator, Bayesian
  personalization.

Every derivation below is verified numerically in
`src/lib/business/model/zenith.test.ts` (integration vs. closed form,
derivatives vs. finite differences, root equations, allocator vs. brute
force).

## 0. Objective

For each task `i`, `p_i(t)` is productivity `t` hours into the task and
`P̄_i(T) = (1/T)∫₀ᵀ p_i(t) dt` its average over a session of length `T`. The
planner maximizes the **sum of average productivities**

```
maximize   Σᵢ P̄ᵢ(tᵢ)
subject to Σᵢ tᵢ + (m − 1)·switchCost ≤ T_budget      (m = tasks with tᵢ > 0)
           [pooled variant] Σᵢ wcᵢ·tᵢ ≤ cognitive pool,  Σᵢ wpᵢ·tᵢ ≤ physical pool
```

This objective (the article's choice, deliberately kept) optimizes the
_quality of hours worked_, not the amount of work done. It is what creates
"optimal stopping" at all: total output `∫p dt` is strictly increasing in `T`
(p > 0 everywhere), so a total-output maximizer would always consume the whole
budget. Under the average-productivity objective, pushing a task past its
optimal stopping time **lowers** the objective, so an abundant budget
correctly leaves slack. (The experimental `zenith-energy.ts` model explores
the total-output alternative; see §8.)

## 1. Inputs and parameter mappings (unchanged from the article)

User inputs per task: difficulty `Eᵤ ∈ [1,10]`, enjoyment `βᵤ ∈ [1,10]`.

```
E = (4/9)·Eᵤ + 5/9   ∈ [1, 5]      (true effort)
β = (1/9)·βᵤ + 8/9   ∈ [1, 2]      (true enjoyability)

ϕ  = c₁E + c₂β + c₃                 (time to reach flow state, hours)
p₀ = β/E                            (initial productivity)
a  = E·β                            (peak productivity scale)
```

Defaults `c₁ = 0.56, c₂ = −0.24, c₃ = 0.5`; ϕ is floored at 0.1h because a
fitted plane can extrapolate to ≤ 0 far from the measured tasks.

**v2 amplitude cap.** The v2 curve (§2) requires `p₀ < a`. With the mappings
above, `p₀/a = 1/E²`, which reaches exactly 1 at `E = 1` (user difficulty 1) —
a degenerate flat curve. We therefore cap the effective ratio:

```
r = p₀/a  clamped to  r ≤ 0.9        (AMPLITUDE_RATIO_CAP)
```

The cap only binds for `E < 1/√0.9 ≈ 1.054`, i.e. user difficulty below
≈ 1.12 — one sliver of the slider — and keeps `k` (below) strictly positive.

## 2. Productivity curve — **v2 change**

### What changed and why

The article defines `p₀ = β/E` as _initial productivity_, but its curve

```
v1:  p(t) = (a + p₀)·k·t·e^(−kt),   k = 1/ϕ
```

forces `p(0) = 0` for every task — `p₀` was silently just an amplitude term,
and the story the article tells about it ("we start easier on enjoyable,
low-effort tasks") was not actually in the math. v2 uses a curve where the
claim is true:

```
v2:  p(t) = (a·k·t + p₀)·e^(−kt),   k = (1 − r)/ϕ,   r = p₀/a
```

### Properties (all verified in tests)

- **Starts at p₀:** `p(0) = p₀`.
- **Peak exactly at ϕ:**
  `p'(t) = k·e^(−kt)·(a − p₀ − a·k·t) = 0  ⇔  t = (a−p₀)/(a·k) = ϕ`
  (this is why `k` changed from `1/ϕ` to `(1−r)/ϕ`).
- **Peak value:** `p(ϕ) = a·e^(r−1)`. First-order in `r` this is
  `(a/e)(1+r) ≈ (a+p₀)/e` — the v1 peak was the small-p₀ approximation of the
  v2 peak, so peak-productivity displays change only slightly.
- **Concave on the working range:** `p'' = 0` at `x = kt = 2 − r`, which is
  always beyond the optimal stopping point `x* ≤ 1.7933` (§3), so the curve
  has no convex kink before you'd stop anyway.
- **Decays to 0** as `t → ∞` — the burnout tail is preserved.

(Pedantic note: the article calls the v1 shape "a Poisson distribution"; it is
a Gamma(2)/Erlang-2 _density_ shape. Poisson is discrete.)

### Average productivity (closed form)

With `x = kT`, `f(x) = 1 − e^(−x)(x+1)`, `g(x) = 1 − e^(−x)`:

```
∫₀ᵀ a·k·t·e^(−kt) dt = (a/k)·f(x)          (integration by parts)
∫₀ᵀ p₀·e^(−kt) dt    = (p₀/k)·g(x)

P̄(T) = a·[f(x) + r·g(x)] / x
```

Series `f ≈ x²/2 − x³/3`, `g ≈ x − x²/2` are used below `x < 10⁻⁴` to avoid
catastrophic cancellation.

### The activation bonus (important structural consequence)

```
lim T→0⁺ P̄(T) = p₀   but   P̄(0) := 0
```

A task you _touch at all_ immediately contributes ≈ p₀ of average
productivity; a task you skip contributes nothing. The objective is therefore
**discontinuous at tᵢ = 0 and not concave** — this is the single deepest
consequence of the v2 curve, and it is what forced the allocator redesign
(§4): v1's Lagrange/KKT machinery ("equalize marginals at λ") and the pooled
dual coordinate descent both _require_ a concave objective, so their
optimality guarantees do not survive the new curve.

### Marginal of the average

```
dP̄/dT = a·k·N(x)/x²,   N(x) = e^(−x)·(x² + (1+r)x + (1+r)) − (1+r)
lim T→0⁺ dP̄/dT = a·k·(1−r)/2 = k(a−p₀)/2
```

The marginal decreases strictly from that limit to 0 at the optimum
(verified across the whole E×β domain) — this monotonicity is what makes the
per-block increments diminishing, which the greedy allocator's exactness
rests on.

## 3. Optimal stopping — **v2 change: per-task, no longer a universal 1.79ϕ**

Setting `N(x) = 0` and rearranging:

```
eˣ = 1 + x + x²/(1+r)
```

- `r = 0` recovers the article's `eˣ = x² + x + 1` with root
  `x* = 1.7933` (kept exported as `OPTIMAL_PHI_MULTIPLIER`, now documented as
  the r→0 limit and upper bound).
- `x*(r)` is strictly decreasing in r. The stopping time is

  ```
  T* = x*(r)/k = ϕ · x*(r)/(1−r)
  ```

- **Multiplier range:** expanding `eˣ` to third order at small x gives
  `x*(r) → 3(1−r)/(1+r)` as r → 1, hence `T*/ϕ → 3/(1+r) → 1.5`. So every
  task stops between **1.5ϕ and 1.7933ϕ**. Interpretation: tasks that start
  productive (high p₀ relative to peak) stop _earlier_ — their early hours
  were already good, so the declining tail drags the average down sooner.
- Solved by 60-step bisection of `q(x) = eˣ − 1 − x − x²/(1+r)` on
  `(0, 1.80]`; `q < 0` before the root and `> 0` after, and the root is
  ≤ 1.7933 for all r ≥ 0. `findOptimalSingleTaskTime` is now closed-form via
  this root — the v1 Newton-Raphson iteration is gone.

The best achievable average `P̄(T*)` is computed per task and exposed as
`TaskAllocation.optimalAvgProductivity`; it replaced the v1 constant
`OPTIMAL_AVG_FRACTION = x/(x²+x+1) ≈ 0.2984` (removed — only valid when the
multiplier was universal). The metric layer's _priority score_ is this value:
a task's intrinsic worth independent of what the current plan gives it.

## 4. Allocation — **v2 change: discrete blocks, exact greedy, exact subset search**

### Why v1's continuous solver was replaced

1. **Humans plan in blocks.** v1 emitted "1.84h"; v2 plans whole 15-minute
   blocks (`BLOCK_HOURS = 0.25`). Budget below one block is left unplanned —
   a sub-15-minute sliver is not a real session.
2. **The activation bonus (§2) broke v1's math.** λ-bisection over "marginal
   = price" cannot see a fixed jump at t = 0, and the pooled dual descent's
   convergence argument assumed concavity. Their "exact" answers were exact
   for a model we no longer have.
3. **The discrete problem is _more_ exactly solvable, not less.** With
   diminishing per-block increments, greedy marginal analysis is provably
   optimal for a single shared budget (Fox 1966; Ibaraki & Katoh 1988) — no
   tolerances, no rescaling patch-ups, no rounding-residual redistribution
   (all deleted).

### The algorithm

Per task, precompute block increments
`Δᵢ(j) = P̄ᵢ(j·δ) − P̄ᵢ((j−1)·δ)`, truncated at the first non-positive value
(the discrete optimal stopping point — later blocks would lower the
objective and are never offered). `Δᵢ(1)` carries the activation bonus
(≈ p₀ᵢ), and subsequent increments decrease — verified across the domain in
tests, including under fast-flow fitted constants that hit the 0.1h ϕ floor.

- **Single budget:** greedily fund the highest remaining increment until the
  block budget runs out. This is _exactly_ optimal (equivalently: take the
  top-B increments of the merged sorted lists; the diminishing property makes
  per-task prefixes valid). Ties break toward lower task index, which
  round-robins identical tasks into the equal split the article's sanity
  check demands.
- **Switch cost (fixed charge):** a plan funding m tasks pays
  `(m−1)·switchCost` off the budget before any block is placed. Which tasks
  deserve funding is a combinatorial decision greedy can't price, so for
  n ≤ 12 we **enumerate every funded subset** (≤ 4095 greedy runs — instant)
  and keep the best plan; ties prefer funding more tasks. This is exact and
  replaced v1's iterative count-resolution + greedy drop-search heuristic.
  A subset that leaves a member at 0 blocks is never strictly better than
  the smaller subset (which gets more budget), so enumeration stays exact
  without special cases. For n > 12: greedy forward selection on the funded
  set (documented heuristic; a daily planner rarely exceeds 12 tasks).
- **Capacity pools:** same greedy, but a block is eligible only while both
  pools can absorb its weights. Multi-constraint greedy is not provably
  exact (multi-dimensional knapsack), and it has a known blind spot: it
  ranks blocks by _value_, not value per unit of _scarce resource_ — e.g. an
  hour off a weight-1.0 task frees enough pool for ~3.3h of a weight-0.3
  task. So whenever greedy was actually blocked by a pool, a
  **resource-aware transfer pass** runs: give back one donor block, greedily
  refill the freed time + pool capacity across the other tasks, keep the
  move only on strict improvement (strictness prevents cycles). Regression
  tests hold the result within 1–2% of brute-force block optima on the
  scenarios that broke earlier heuristics; the single-constraint path skips
  the pass entirely and keeps its exactness.

The allocator's verified exactness claim, precisely stated: **for the
single-budget problem with switch cost and n ≤ 12, the returned plan attains
the true maximum of the objective over all block-quantized plans.** (Test:
brute force over every block distribution × funded-subset overhead.)

## 5. Personalization — **v2 change: full Bayesian posterior**

The article prescribes measuring time-to-flow ("⚡ logs") and fitting
`ϕ = c₁E + c₂β + c₃` by least squares. v1 already used ridge regression
toward the defaults; v2 recognizes that ridge as the MAP of a Bayesian model
and exposes the whole posterior:

```
Model:      ϕᵢ = c·xᵢ + εᵢ,   εᵢ ~ N(0, σ²/wᵢ),   xᵢ = [Eᵢ, βᵢ, 1]
Prior:      c ~ N(c₀, (σ²/λ)·I),   c₀ = defaults,   λ = 4
Weights:    wᵢ = γ^(n−1−i)   (optional forgetting factor γ ≤ 1;
            γ = 1 → all equal, v1 behavior)

Posterior:  mean  ĉ = (XᵀWX + λI)⁻¹(XᵀWϕ + λc₀)     ← identical to v1's ridge
            cov   Σ = σ̂²·(XᵀWX + λI)⁻¹
Noise:      σ̂² = (ν₀σ₀² + Σwᵢ(ϕᵢ − ĉ·xᵢ)²)/(ν₀ + Σwᵢ),
            σ₀ = 0.25h (15-minute stopwatch noise floor), ν₀ = 4
Predictive: std of a new measurement at (E, β):  √(σ̂² + xᵀΣx)
```

Why: **the point estimate the allocator consumes is unchanged** (no behavior
change from v1 fits), but a 2-log fit and a 200-log fit are no longer
indistinguishable — `phiPredictionStd` quantifies it (parameter uncertainty
shrinks with data and grows with distance from the logged region). Intended
uses: UI bands ("ϕ ≈ 1.4h ± 0.4h") and future robust allocation. The
forgetting factor is for users whose flow behavior drifts (recursive-least-
squares style; γ ≈ 0.98 ≙ ~50-log half-life).

Unchanged v1 safeguards: fallback to defaults on zero observations or when
the fitted plane predicts ϕ > 16h anywhere on the domain; negative
predictions at unobserved corners are allowed (fast-flow users legitimately
tilt the plane) and absorbed by the 0.1h floor.

## 7. Known approximations and deliberate non-changes

- **Naive baselines stay continuous.** `productivityGain` /
  `pooledProductivityGain` compare against an equal split that is _not_
  block-quantized: quantization is part of what Zenith imposes, not part of
  what a naive planner does.
- **Pooled greedy + transfer pass is a heuristic** (multi-dimensional
  knapsack is NP-hard); tested to within 1–2% of brute force on the
  regression scenarios. Single-budget remains exact.
- **Forward selection for n > 12 funded-subset search** is a heuristic for a
  regime a daily planner rarely reaches.
- **Budgets below 0.25h are left unplanned** (v1 would allocate slivers).
- **`zenith-energy.ts` intentionally still uses the v1 curve.** It is an
  experimental, standalone, total-output model with its own fatigue
  dynamics (documented in §8); migrating it to the v2 curve is a separate
  decision.
- **`a = E·β` (peak monotone in effort) is kept from the article** even
  though flow research suggests an inverted-U in challenge (see references);
  changing it alters the meaning of the difficulty slider and deserves its
  own revision.

## 8. Energy model (`zenith-energy.ts`) — fatigue-recovery extensions

The experimental total-output model keeps the v1 curve (see §7) but got two
literature-grounded corrections on 2026-07-13. Both were driven by an
empirical probe of the old behavior: on a 10-hour window with a demanding
task the optimizer scheduled **zero** interior rest, and micro-breaks always
_reduced_ output at equal work-hours — contradicting the well-replicated
finding that short interspersed breaks raise total output (Jaber & Neumann
2010; Bechtold, Janaro & Sumners 1984).

### 8.1 Intermittent-rest recovery correction

The reservoir law `dC/dτ = −α·w·C + r·(1−w)·(1−C)` shares its structure with
the three-compartment muscle fatigue model of Xia & Frey Law (2008). That
model's documented failure mode is ours too: it **over-predicts fatigue when
rest intervals are interspersed with work**, and the published fix (Looft,
Herkert & Frey Law 2018) is a multiplier on the recovery rate. We adopt it:

```text
r' = r · restRecoveryMultiplier          (default 1.5)
ρ  = α·w + r'·(1−w),   C_eq = r'·(1−w)/ρ
```

The existing `(1−w)` gate concentrates the boost exactly where the reservoir
is idle — full effect at rest, none at full demand — so the closed-form
solution and Simpson quadrature are unchanged. `restRecoveryMultiplier = 1`
reproduces the old dynamics.

### 8.2 Warm-up carryover instead of binary reset

v1 energy reset the session phase `s` to 0 on _any_ interruption: a 5-minute
switch cost as much warm-up as a 3-hour gap, which is empirically wrong —
task-resumption cost grows with interruption duration (Monk, Trafton &
Boehm-Davis 2008), consistent with exponential decay of goal activation
(Altmann & Trafton 2002, memory-for-goals). Warm-up is now **per task with
decaying carryover**: leaving a task at phase `s_end` and returning after a
gap `g` resumes at

```text
s_resume = s_end · e^(−g/τ),   τ = resumptionTimeConstant   (default 0.5 h)
```

With τ = 0.5 h, ~85% of task state survives a 5-minute break and ~2% survives
a 2-hour gap. `blockOutput` integrates `p(s_resume + u)` over block-local time
`u`; the reservoirs stay indexed by `u` since they carry their own level.
`resumptionTimeConstant ≤ 0` reproduces the old hard reset. Because `p(s)` is
hump-shaped, one decay does double duty: below the peak it prices lost warm-up
(breaks hurt), above it prices boredom relief (a break moves you back toward
the peak).

### 8.3 Verified consequences and an open calibration question

Post-fix probes (locked in as unit tests): the optimizer now inserts interior
rest on long demanding windows (6 breaks on the 10-hour probe, a Pomodoro-like
pattern), and a ~30-minute break placed mid-session _raises_ total output at
equal work-hours — the Jaber–Neumann result the old model could not produce.
Fragmentation still costs (contiguous ≈ 1.5× confetti on the standard probe),
just no longer catastrophically.

**Open:** making sustained work efficient made it attractive. At the default
`freeTimeValue = 0.5` the optimizer now recommends ≈ 9.9 h of work in a 12-hour
window (pre-fix ≈ 5.4 h), and because the leisure term is _linear_ in hours the
response to `freeTimeValue` is bang-bang: ≈ 1.0 still yields ≈ 9.5 h, ≈ 1.5
collapses to all-leisure. A humane default day needs a structural change — a
concave (diminishing-returns) leisure value or a soft work-hour cap — not a
retuned constant. Defaults were deliberately left alone pending that decision.
