/**
 * Measurement behind MATH.md §8.6's claim that the compound moves made the
 * multi-seed steepest-ascent search reliable — no stranded ~1% of objective and
 * no wrong plan STRUCTURE (a funded task dropped, or an unfunded one bought).
 * §8.6's evidence is two hand-built witnesses and one legacy objective pair; the
 * residual optimality gap over an input space was never measured, and the worse
 * failure mode it names — the wrong funded set — was never measured at all.
 *
 * A probe, not a test: it answers "what is true of the model over a large input
 * space" and prints numbers, where a test answers "does this still hold" and is
 * binary. The gap below legitimately moves whenever a move, a seed, the step
 * lattice or the objective changes, which is why this runs on demand
 * (`npm run probe`) and never in `npm test` — in the suite it would go red on
 * every honest model change while its real signal, the size of the number, is
 * not a regression at all.
 *
 * Both tiers score `optimizeSchedule` against a reference optimum on the SAME
 * DEFAULT_STEP_HOURS lattice, so nothing here measures quantization (§8.8) —
 * only search slack:
 *
 * - ENUMERATED: small enough to enumerate every lattice plan (each 45-min slot
 *   independently assigned to a task or rest), so the reference IS the optimum
 *   and a shortfall is a proven search defect. This tier is what can falsify
 *   §8.6.
 * - APPROX: a long random-restart hill climb, labelled APPROX because it is a
 *   LOWER bound on the true optimum — a 0 there is evidence, not proof, and a
 *   negative gap just means the product search beat the reference.
 *
 * Whatever it prints belongs in MATH.md WITH ITS DATE, beside the claim it
 * supports (AGENTS.md §4).
 *
 * Usage: npm run probe
